# GetCleanData
Course Project for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data (John Hopkins Data Science)

This repo contains a CodeBook `CodeBook.md` that explains the process behind the 'R' `run_analysis.R` script file.
These files were created to meet the course objective of demonstrating the ability to download a data set from the web and 
clean the file, tidy it and export it into another usable data set `tidydata.txt`.

The CodeBook was originally produced as an R markdown file and exported to html as `CodeBook.html` that is also in the repo.
